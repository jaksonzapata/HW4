## AI Tool #1

## Tool Name

ChatGPT

### Version/Model

ChatGPT 5

### Date(s) Used

10/30/25 – 10/31/25

### Specific Parts of Assignment

I used ChatGPT to check the HW3 code against the HW3 requirements and rules. It produced a pass/fail checklist for each rule.

I also used it to make a very small code change: replace all places where I was printing Error: undeclared identifier: <name> with the exact required Error: undeclared identifier.

I also used it to comment the code.

### Prompts Used

"Check all of these requirements/rules (Copied and pasted it the requirements), and check my code to check that i followed all the requirements and rules."

"Can you identify where undeclared identifier problem is? Give me the lines where I have to make the changes."

### AI Output/Results

It analyzed both files and gave me a detailed compliance report with passes and fixes.

It returned the lines of code that needed to be changed to fix the error string for undeclared identifiers.


### How Output was Verified/Edited

I recompiled on Eustis and ran the parser on my test inputs. I triggered undeclared identifier cases in assignment, factor, and read to confirm the exact error text is now Error: undeclared identifier in both terminal and elf.txt.

I checked that the comments the AI added were actually correct and made sense.

No other edits were applied to the code besides the requested error-text change.

### Multiple Iterations (if applicable)


### Learning & Reflection

In this assignment ChatGPT helped me focus on exact rubric details. I was scared because I know how strict autograders can be with exact error strings and how a single extra word can fail a test. AI helped not stress too much about it ny checking that all the rules/requirements/outputs were matching. Also it helped me comment the code to improve its readability.
