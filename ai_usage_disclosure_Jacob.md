### Prompts Used
Given the provided instructions can you explain what still needs to be done 

Can you explain why I'm not getting the right output as well as steps to fix the issue

This is my final code after implementing changes does everything look right?

### AI Output/Results
The AI highlighted where I went wrong in my code as well as provided steps to take in order to resolve the issues

Let me know that my code was looking good and no errors were detected

### How Output was Verified/Edited
